Hereâ€™s a README content template for implementing left and right rotations on an array with even size:

Array Rotations (Even-Sized Array)
This project demonstrates left and right rotations on an array of even size. Array rotation involves shifting elements of the array to the left or right by a specified number of positions.

Features
Rotate an array left or right by any number of positions.
Works specifically for arrays with even length.
Handles edge cases, such as rotations exceeding the array's length.
